Personalized Media Art Generation via Brainwave (EEG) Analysis
üé® EmotionArt: Brainwave Media Art
### 1. üß† Emotion Analysis & Visualization
**Real-time Brainwave Analysis**: Measures a user's brainwave (EEG) signals in real-time using a Neurosky Mindwave device as they listen to their favorite music.

**Deep Learning for Emotion Classification**: Utilizes a Supervised Learning model, developed in Python, to analyze the raw brainwave data and classify the user's emotional state into six core categories (e.g., romantic, dynamic).

**From Emotion to Color**: A unique system that visualizes emotions by assigning a predefined color palette to each classified emotional state, creating a unique visual identity for the user's feelings.

### 2. ‚ú® Personalized Media Art
**One-of-a-Kind Artwork**: Generates abstract, personalized media art that serves as a visual representation of the user's inner emotional landscape, offering a unique form of self-reflection.

**Intuitive Result Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface where users can visually confirm their analysis results, including brainwave graphs, emotion similarity scores, and the final color palette before viewing their media art.

**Real-time Interaction with MediaPipe**: Integrates MediaPipe to enable direct, real-time interaction with the media art, allowing users to influence the visuals with their movements for a deeply engaging experience.

The result of the deep learning model analyzing the brainwaves, converting the user's current state into similarity scores with six core emotions. The emotion with the highest score dictates the primary theme of the media art.

An individual's "Emotion Color Chip," generated based on the analyzed emotion data. Each color represents the type and intensity of an emotion and is used as a core visual element in the media art.
