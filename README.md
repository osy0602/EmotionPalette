Personalized Media Art Generation via Brainwave (EEG) Analysis
🎨 EmotionArt: Brainwave Media Art
### 1. 🧠 AI-Powered Emotion Analysis & Visualization
**Real-time Brainwave Analysis**: Measures a user's brainwave (EEG) signals in real-time using a Neurosky Mindwave device as they listen to their favorite music.

**Deep Learning for Emotion Classification**: Utilizes a Supervised Learning model, developed in Python, to analyze the raw brainwave data and classify the user's emotional state into six core categories (e.g., romantic, dynamic).

**From Emotion to Color**: A unique system that visualizes emotions by assigning a predefined color palette to each classified emotional state, creating a unique visual identity for the user's feelings.

### 2. ✨ Personalized Media Art
**One-of-a-Kind Artwork**: Generates abstract, personalized media art that serves as a visual representation of the user's inner emotional landscape, offering a unique form of self-reflection.

**Intuitive Result Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface where users can visually confirm their analysis results, including brainwave graphs, emotion similarity scores, and the final color palette before viewing their media art.

**Real-time Interaction with MediaPipe**: Integrates MediaPipe to enable direct, real-time interaction with the media art, allowing users to influence the visuals with their movements for a deeply engaging experience.
